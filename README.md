This is a Rails application to collaboratively estimate stories.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems running the setup script:

```
$ ./bin/setup
```

## Environment Variables

`ORGANIZATION_LOGIN`: This is the organization name as it appears in the GitHub URL, for instance `orgname` in https://github.com/orgname. It is needed to check if users are a part of the organization. Ensure that your membership is set to _public_ when you visit https://github.com/orgs/orgname/people.

If you don't belong to any organization, you can set up one here: https://github.com/organizations/plan

Make sure you add your organization to the `.env` file like this:

```
ORGANIZATION_LOGIN=orgname
```

`GITHUB_APP_ID` and `GITHUB_APP_SECRET`: These are the credentials of the OAuth GitHub App that you need to create. Follow the instructions on this link to create one: [Creating an OAuth GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)

When creating the OAuth GitHub App, the `Homepage URL` field should be set to http://localhost:3000, and the `Authorization callback URL` should be http://localhost:3000/users/auth/github/callback.

Once you create the app and generate credentials for it, make sure you add them to the `.env` file like this:

```
GITHUB_APP_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
GITHUB_APP_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Starting the Server

```
$ rails s
```

Go to http://localhost:3000

## Running Tests

```
$ rails spec
```

## Using Docker

> NOTE: You'll need to have docker and docker-compose installed

Build the points docker image

```bash
./bin/setup_with_docker
```

Run the app

```
./bin/start_with_docker

or

docker-compose up web-next
```

## Admin Users

Users are created without admin privileges by default, because admin users have access to a few more features related to reports and setting real score of stories.

Currently, the only way to flag a user as `admin` is a direct database update using either postgres cli or the rails console.

If you want to set the flag for a user, you can follow these steps:

```bash
rails console

or

docker-compose run --rm web rails console
```

and then:

```ruby
User.find_by(email: "user@example.com").update_attribute(:admin, true)
```
